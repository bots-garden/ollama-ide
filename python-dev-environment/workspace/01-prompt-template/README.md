LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)

LangChain Expression Language, or LCEL, is a declarative way to easily compose chains together. 


https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/chains

Chains refer to sequences of calls - whether to an LLM, a tool, or a data preprocessing step. The primary supported way to do this is with LCEL.
LCEL is great for constructing your own chains.
